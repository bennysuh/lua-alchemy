#summary Documents extended AS3 interface

These functions are implemented in Lua. If you do not need this functionality, you may strip it. See UsingRawLuaAlchemy.

===as3.onclose(function)===
Function to call when !LuaAlchemy#close() is called.  This will typically be used to call removeListener() and do any other necessary AS3 cleanup. You may register any number of such callbacks by calling `as3.onclose()` multiple times. Callbacks would be called in the same order as they were added.
Example
{{{
as3.onclose(
  function(e)
    timer.stop()
    timer.removeEventListener(as3.class.flash.events.TimerEvent.TIMER, movebox)
  end)
}}}

*Note:* Flash doesn't reliably call anything when a Flex application is closed so the intention of this function is to do cleanup when you are creating and closing !LuaAlchemy objects numerous times during a single instance of Flash.  The cleanup is less important on shutdown of Flash since everything is stopped and all memory is recovered.

===as3.makeprinter(output)===
Returns print-like function, which appends its arguments to `output.text`, where output is arbitrary as3 object.

Example
{{{
print = as3.makeprinter(output)
print("Hello from Lua")
}}}
