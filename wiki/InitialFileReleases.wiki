#summary List of planned initial file releases for the Lua Alchemy project

= Initial file releases =

Mentioned items are more like tangents to the main project, but they may help to attract some attention.

== 1. Alchemy's lua and luac executables for OS X and Windows (and maybe Linux) ==

So interested people would be able to play with the tech without
the need to setup whole build chain.

*Problem*:

Alchemy's "executables" aren't really executables, they are swfs in a shell script with the following to execute them:

{{{ #!/Users/universalmind/code/alchemy-darwin-v0.4a/bin/swfbridge }}}

*TODO:* Looks like we would have to redistribute unknown amounts of Alchemy and Flex. This needs some research. It may be easier to provide detailed step-by-step build instructions.

*TODO:* Lua's `make generic` omits some useful features like libreadline. We should try to tune our build to include them.


== 2. Benchmarks for the relevant Lua code ===

Use code from Lua test/ folder (as in [http://lua-users.org/lists/lua-l/2008-08/msg00591.html this] post ) and from the [http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32q/lua.php Shootout].

Both code and the results so everyone would be able to reproduce them.


== 3. Official [http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/lua/lua5.1-tests.tar.gz Lua Test Suite] run results ===

As in [http://groups.google.com/group/lua-alchemy-dev/msg/996ec28605346254 this] post.


== 4. Lua console GUI emulation ==

This probably it is most spectacular thing we're able to pull out without
implementing Lua to !ActionScript bridge. Simply rewrite lua.c to be usable from AS side; no fancy tricks on this step. It is a nice demo anyway, and mentioned bridge may be integrated into it later.
