#summary The list of known problems.

  * In Alchemy calls across C / !ActionScript boundary are slow.

  * We've got Lua VM running inside !ActionScript VM. This is also slow. It should be possible to convert Lua bytecode to AS bytecode directly with the help of [http://code.google.com/p/llvm-lua/ llvm-lua]. But see [http://marc.info/?l=lua-l&m=122847990506358&w=2 this post]: currently Alchemy uses outdated version of LLVM (2.1), which is incompatible with one in llvm-lua (2.4). We should try to encourage Alchemy developers to upgrade.
