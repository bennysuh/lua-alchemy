#summary The recommended way of coding Lua Alchemy

Following these rules would lead to less conflicts on merge (not to say to cleaner code):

1. Use spaces, no tabs. Perferably two spaces per indent. Never mix tabs with spaces in indentation.

2. Use Unix line endings, not Windows. Never mix different line endings in a file

3. Do trim trailing spaces on save.
