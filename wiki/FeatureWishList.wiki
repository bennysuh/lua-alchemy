#summary The list of desired features of Lua Alchemy project

= Target platform =

  * Lua 5.1.4, *unmodified*
  * Flash *10*
  * Flex is *not required* to use core functionality
  * *No paid tools* (e.g. !FlexBuilder) should be required to use library, just the free *command-line SDK tools*.
  * Library must be usable on *OS X 10.5+* and *Windows XP* (Vista support is not guaranteed). Support for *Linux* is likely. 

= Extra features =

  * Flex *data bindings* support is available as a feature, *optional* for end-user.

= Lua Support =

  * *Full* support for the *language*
  * As much as possible of the *Core Lua Libraries* is to be supported. See below.

== Lua being able to create arbitrary !ActionScript objects ==

== Lua being able to call !ActionScript getter ==

Lua:
{{{ a = asobj.field }}}

== Lua being able to call !ActionScript setter ==  

Lua:
{{{ asobj.field = a }}}

== Lua being able to call !ActionScript funciton ==

Lua:
{{{ v.realFunctionName(param1, param2, ... paramN) }}}
