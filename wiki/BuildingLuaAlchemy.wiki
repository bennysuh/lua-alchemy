#summary Building Lua Alchemy
#labels Phase-Deploy,Featured

Note that you do not need to build Lua Alchemy to use it â€” you may just get a pre-build SWC from [http://code.google.com/p/lua-alchemy/downloads/list Downloads].

But if you want to contribute something or just to play around with sources, you'll have to be able to build Lua Alchemy from scratch.

To be able to do this, you'll need:

  * make
  * ant
  * Recent Adobe Flex SDK: http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexsdk/Setup
  * Recent Adobe Alchemy SDK: http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Alchemy:Documentation:Getting_Started

Toolchain installation on Windows is described here: SetupFlexSdkAlchemyOnWindows. On other platforms (Linux and OS X) it is pretty straightforward.

===Troubleshooting===

  * Ensure that you have run alc-on, and did not run it twice. 
  * Open a fresh terminal and build from there if strange build issues arise.
  * On Windows, make sure that your user name does contain only Latin characters.
