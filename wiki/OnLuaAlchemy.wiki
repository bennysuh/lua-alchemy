#summary A draft for initial project documentation

= Introduction =

This text is a source for the initial project documentation draft and is based on the results of private discussions between me and Robert. It is intended to be split to multiple documents when it would mature a bit.

Comments are welcome.

  * FeatureWishList
  * KnownProblems

== Background ==

Lua is a great dynamic programming language, Adobe Flash is a great universal platform for applications and Adobe Alchemy is the tool to bind them together.

*TODO:* We should copy-paste some white-paper paragraphs on each technology here, along with proper links

== Motivation ==

We need Lua Alchemy to...

  * ...To use run-time dynamic programming language (Lua) within the Flash framework. 
  * ...To reuse existing Lua code for the Flash-based utilities
  * ...To get a great cross-platform back-end (Flash) for (simpler) Lua-based games
  * ...To have fun with awesome new technology :-)

= Organization =

== Sites ==
