    Simply unpack it somewhere.

= Build steps =

1. Fire up you terminal (Cygwin shell if you're on Windows).

2. Change current directory to where you've unpacked Lua sources

    $ cd ~/lua-5.1.4 
}}}

3. Enable Alchemy tools

{{{ 
    $ alc-on 
}}}

4. Run make

5. That is it, Lua is compiled to Flash. Try it!
{{{ 
    $ cd src
    $ ./lua
}}}
